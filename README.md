# Programming-Style-Autograder

This product is being made to streamline student file grading in computer science and other coding-related classes. 
The goal of this product is to allow a class instructor to run a program, provide the program with their grading preferences and their studentsâ€™ files, and return to the instructor a report detailing how each student performed within the stylistic parameters, as well as a recommended score for that file.
